# Srijon Datta | üíß Water Science & Environmental Modeling

Hello! I'm **Srijon Datta**, an environmental and water science professional specializing in data-driven solutions for global water challenges.

My expertise is centered on **hydrological modeling**, **geospatial analysis**, and assessing the impacts of climate and land use change on water resources. I applied robust models to support sustainable water management, from securing water for domestic and irrigation use to maintaining in-stream flow for biodiversity.

I am a recent graduate of the prestigious **Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree in Groundwater and Global Change (GroundwatCH)**, a joint program of IHE Delft (Netherlands), TU Dresden (Germany), and IST Lisbon (Portugal).

## üåé Key Areas of Expertise

* **Hydrological & Hydrogeological Modeling**: Simulating complex water systems using tools like **SWAT** and **MODFLOW** to manage surface and groundwater resources conjunctively.
* **Water Quality & Pollution Assessment**: Investigating non-point source pollution risks and the effects of rapid land use change on water quality in semi-urban coastal areas.
* **Geospatial Analysis & Remote Sensing**: Leveraging **QGIS** and **ArcGIS** to analyze watershed characteristics, monitor land cover change, and support environmental modeling.
* **Climate Change Adaptation**: Assessing climate impacts on water systems and developing adaptation strategies, including managed aquifer recharge.
* **Flood Risk Management**: Developing hydraulic and hydrological models for flood risk assessment, with a specific focus on challenges in data-scarce developing countries.
